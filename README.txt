The name of this language is TheMostAverageLanguageEver, implemented with a stack-based paradigm. Features include stack manipulations, while loops, naming conventions (for local variable declarations and functions) and basic math operations. 

Instructions:
Run in GHCi, load Project.hs. 

To run goodExample 1, execute "prog goodExample1 empty []" in GHCi. Note that the result should be Just [S "Non-Leap Year"], because the coded year is 1900. To test a different year that may be a leap year, change "1900" in the code to the desired year.

To run badExample 1 & badExample2, execute "prog badExample1 empty []" and "prog badExample2 empty []" respectively in GHCi. The expected output for both is "Nothing" where badExample1 causes a type error and badExample2 causes an underflow error.
